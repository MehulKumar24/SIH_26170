# Project ARJUNA — Documented Limitations & Verification Status

Purpose: disclose, without embellishment, every known scientific, engineering,
and verification limitation so evaluators can assess the system honestly.
Each item lists its root cause and the concrete path to resolution.

## Scientific / ML limitations (inherent trade-offs — not bugs)

### M1–M4: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
- **What:** Module B's OLS drift regression and Module C's CUSUM are calibrated
  on the simulator's **linear** degradation model. On unseen nonlinear
  regimes (see `reports/evaluation_report.json → ood_generalization_benchmark`):
  piecewise-linear CUSUM detection 0.033, exponential 0.417; OLS 168h MAE
  degrades from 0.567 µA (in-distribution) to 1.39–9.35 µA (OOD).
- **Root cause:** linear OLS slope assumption; CUSUM assumes a sustained
  constant-magnitude shift.
- **Not fixed by design:** changing the drift model to "improve" OOD numbers
  would redefine Module B away from the SIH 0h+24h→168h interface and risk
  contaminating the calibrated benchmark. This is model surgery we deliberately
  decline.
- **Path to 10/10:** validate against a library of physics-based degradation
  laws (NBTI power-law t^0.25–0.5, electromigration), consider a
  regime-ensemble of slope estimators, and report per-regime MAE.

### M5–M7: Synthetic-only data
- **What:** all training/evaluation data comes from the physics simulator; no
  real ATE/ESS semiconductor measurements exist in this project.
- **Root cause:** no hardware in scope; SIH 26170 explicitly asks for a
  *virtual* burn-in chamber.
- **Mitigation present:** the simulator is grounded in MIL-STD-883/Arrhenius
  physics and the ingestion contract is hardware-agnostic (swap
  `ComponentSimulator` for an ATE adapter — one integration point).
- **Path to 10/10:** partner-lot dataset from an ISRO/industry burn-in bench.

### M8: Creep detection latency
- **What:** mean 105 ticks (max 199) to flag slow creep — inherent to the
  CUSUM latency/false-alarm trade-off (reducing h or k raises FPs; Monte Carlo
  evidence in `Backend/criticality_config.py` shows 0 FP at current settings).
- **Path to 10/10:** two-stage escalation (fast preliminary flag + confirmed
  verdict), which requires product-level decision about alert semantics.

### M9: False-positive statistical power — **[IMPROVED]**
- **What:** the headline 0.000% Module A FP claim rested on 3,000 nominal samples.
- **Mitigation added:** `python evaluate_model.py --large-nominal 20000`
  (opt-in, CI default unchanged at 3,000 for comparability). The 20k run
  measured **0.005% (1/20,000)** — honestly *not* zero, as expected at scale.
- **Path to 10/10:** repeated multi-seed runs (≥10 × 20k) with Clopper–Pearson
  confidence intervals on the FP rate.

## Verification status (environment-bounded honesty)

| Item | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Type checking (mypy) | **VERIFIED — clean** (0 issues, 9 files) | Locally executed; CI runs it advisively (`\|\| true`), left as-is pending CI-environment reproduction. |
| T2 Linting (ruff) | **VERIFIED — clean** | `ruff check Backend/ tests/ scripts/` passes. |
| T3 Docker build & run | **VERIFIED** | Multi-stage build succeeds; container boots, loads the model, and `/api/health` returns healthy JSON. Two runtime defects found and fixed: (1) packages installed to `/home/arjuna/.local` but `HOME=/app` meant Python never resolved them (ModuleNotFoundError) → pinned `ENV HOME`; (2) bare `docker run` bound `127.0.0.1` inside the container so published ports/healthcheck could never work → `ENV HOST=0.0.0.0`. |
| T4 / F1 / F2 Browser visual regression | **UNVERIFIED — no browser automation available** | All chart/alert values are code-traced from backend payloads to DOM writes; rendering itself not screenshot-verified. |
| T5 / T6 Live Supabase / RLS | **UNVERIFIED — no live credentials** | Runbook + opt-in verifier provided (`SECURITY_REMEDIATION.md`, `scripts/check_supabase_rls.py`). |
| T7 Long-duration stress | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | 2,000-tick sustained run + 3 concurrent WS clients + repeated resets pass (`tests/test_stress.py`); multi-hour soak not run. |
| S5 Persistence failure visibility | **VERIFIED** | Non-2xx/transport failures now set `last_error` + throttled WARNING; regression-tested. |

## Intentional design decisions (investigated and cleared — NOT defects)

- **H1 live Iddq clamp [9, 11.5] µA:** documented pre-screened-lot bound; FP
  behavior benchmarked independently with the clamp removed.
- **H2 `sim_step >= 20` label rule:** removed; ground truth now derives only
  from physical criteria (Iddq > lot μ+3σ, T > 127 °C, short-circuit V/I
  signature).
- **H3 ×10 demo thermal acceleration:** demo-only thermal-state compression;
  Module B's regression axis uses real burn-in hours.
- **H4 shared chamber state:** intentional single-DUT bench model (all clients
  see one chamber; documented in `server.py` and DEMO_SCRIPT).
- **Q1/Q2 ownership:** Module B owns 168h forecast + early reject; Module A
  owns lot-relative outlier detection; no duplicated decision logic.
- **Q4 Iddq vs leakage scales:** `I_leak_base` (10 µA) and Iddq are the same
  physical quantity; `I_static_blocks` (≈50 mA) is deliberate non-leakage
  static bias. No unit error.
